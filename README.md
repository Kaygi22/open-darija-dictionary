# Open darija

open darija is a project that it's seeking to provide the first Moroccan darija's language dictionary for words polarity. This project is open source and free for any data scientist, student, engineer or any other person interested in the project.  


**The first version:**

The first version will be uploaded once we get enough words in our databases. After every new 1000 words, we will update the dictionary and add more trusted words.
